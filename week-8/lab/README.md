
## 📝 Scenario-Based Lab: Database Migration

You have been hired as a Database Administrator in a film production company. The company currently uses MySQL to manage its database, but your manager has requested a migration to PostgreSQL. 

The reasons are:
- Cost savings
- Better features and performance in PostgreSQL

Your task is to migrate the database without losing any data, ensure the new system is ready for use, and update the company’s full-stack application so it works with PostgreSQL instead of MySQL. The estimated time for this task is 3 days.
